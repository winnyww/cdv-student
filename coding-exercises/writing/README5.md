This storytelling was published around the milestone time that 100'000 lives was lost due to covid-19. An article is shown paragraph by paragraph when the user scrolls, between each two paragraphs silhouettes of many individuals are in the background and every now and then, their names and basic information will show up. It is a reminder that the lives we lost during covid were real human beings with stories.

This website is more dreamy than I could imagine! It visualizes twenty dreams first by plain text from the dreamer, by clicking the text, they will instantly scatter and disappear, like how dreams disappear after waking up. In the white background, some faint colors leave their traces like dreams leave their emotions to us.
