Response to Reading 1 (sorry I submitted later than noon)

Before unpacking what “context” is, it is important to understand data needs to be analyzed to make sense. “Every discipline and disciplinary institution has its own norms and standards for the imagination of data, ” it is a bliss that numbers have a universal meaning, a certain quantity. However at the same time, universality is a limitation because the numbers won’t be useful unless they are in a certain context. In a word, the data is ingredients and the context is the recipe, how to use the data, how to turn it into something meaningful.

The importance of context lies in the ability for interpretation. It’s not hard to read numbers, or to develop a sort of pattern from the numbers. Additionally, the stability of numbers - never changing, offering only precise quantitative meaning - forms a sense of security, or an illusion that these datas are as precise as the reality. Not to get into the discussion of whether we can perceive reality at all, but with different context - recipes - to read the data, the perception of reality is different. Just like the examples of attempting to perceive relationship status by reading data without the context of tie strength.

I think a good example of lack of context is that some mainstream Chinese media is portraying China as the second powerful country in the world using the Gross domestic product (GDP) ranking. It’s almost ridiculous to ignore the context of the population or economic structure of China and so much more while making such a statement.

In comparison of these two (groups of) authors, they have a lot to disagree considering they published with a gap of five years, and the former one is more critical, the latter is advocating visualization.

The second author connects context to personalization of the visual design. In agreement with the first author about the importance of context to understand data, the second author emphasizes the contextual process genuinely puts humans in the center. Furthermore, she hopes this personal approach brings more meaningful narratives.

And I have no objection to that. Contextualizing data, with additional background information or visualized narratives, is positively reclaiming data for a certain purpose and effect. This trend coincides with the increasing attention on human-centered ideologies, and it will definitely push the use of data/big data closer to our lives.
