This the coding exercise to start Data Zine Project

Elements I have for this project include (format is: element name < how will the visual distinguish)
  (1) location < direction of visualization
  (2) people around me < warm colors for familiar faces, cold colors for strangers
  (3) did I unlock my phone < left/right side of the visualization
  (4) apps I checked < symbols such as >>> ***
  (5) time of checking these apps < length of the curves
