Either it is biased information or purposeful interruption, the nature of individual contribution has defined the digital project of Wikipedia with a sense of human touch. It is simply not possible to avoid irrational behavior or limitation that both originates from individuals or the society. Thus, this project intends to tell a story of Wikipedia edit history, dissecting one of the worldâ€™s biggest data storage and retracing the voice of individual contributors.

## The Process

1. Why did you choose to visualize the data in this way?

I choose to mimic the [main interface](https://stats.wikimedia.org/#/metrics/en.wikipedia.org) of Wikipedia for
this website, especially with the search box and button. In my proposal, I divide the experience into four stages, from macro to micro, thus it would make a fun experience for the user to enter input and click the search button to jump to the next page. For the first dataset, 'total edit number by month', I want to deliver the main message that there are enormous edit numbers on Wikipedia page. Therefore, I chose line chart and added the input number from the user, so there is a comparison between the user's perception and the actual data. For the second dataset, 'countries with the most active editors', the message that I want to deliver is that editors from a limited number of countries in fact dominate the information on Wikipedia. There is also a comparison to emphasize on this message. For the third dataset, '100 most edited pages by the rank', I want to deliver the message that the most edited pages in fact that the ones we normally see or use, but the functional pages to keep Wikipedia platform function. In the end, I collected a whole page of Wikipedian names to give credits to their good work!

Generally all the datasets surprise me in one way or another. During my own user testing, I get to see my own reception much less than the actual data, and that the pages for Malaysian missing light and covid-19 are the two pages ranked higher than functional pages. Specifically, I didn't realize how many personal commented Wikipedians leave in the edit history.If I have more time, I would make more interactions for user's input, especially the 100 most edited pages, since during the IMA show most people were interested in the guessing game.
