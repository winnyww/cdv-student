<What data did you choose to collect?>

  The data I collected based on the time when I checked my phone for nothing, in other words, purposeless wasting time on
  my phone. The prominent element of this series of data is the time length (how many seconds I wasted on my phone), but many relevant information is also important, who I was with when I wasted time, what I wanted to check. All of these elements reconstruct these moments I collect, and by putting all the data together, they tell interesting stories:
  for example, many times I started checking without even knowing it during my online classes on Zoom, and most of time
  I checked Wechat moments.

<How did you collect it, was was the routine?>

  I created a Google Form for myself to enter data. I had a test round for about three days, during when I entered few sets of data and made adjustments to the questions at the same time. It turns out I would have this routine at least
  twice every day. Very funny, my boyfriend was very supportive for this project. And he enjoyed catching me wasting and
  supervising me entering the data. So it results as he was among the top of "people I was with".

<Why did you choose to visualize the data in this way?>

  The first reason is that I like integrated generative art visuals. Second, since I'm collecting time being wasted,
  I hope to represent the overall amount to show that even though each entry was just couple of seconds, in general,
  they make up a good amount of time wasted.

<What can be seen in the visualization? Does it reveal something you didn't expect?>

  Generally, viewers can see all the data entries together forming a huge vortex. Some lines are dashed showing that I wasted time without even unlocking my phone. They are placed in chronological order from the center to the periphery and the density of lines represent the amount of time. I assign each person whom I was with a color, and each colored shape to the apps. So, in one sentence, viewer can see an abstract amount of time wasted by me, when I was with somebody, wanted to check something but probably ended up checking something else.
  of time I wasted

(Did you make crucial compromises? Which ones?>

  I like the abstract art I made, but I did make compromises. There is one more data I wanted to include, locations. The initial idea was to use pie chart labels and use text to show. However, it interrupted the overall abstract aesthetics. So I chose to ignore them because the existing data is already pretty rich.

<If this project had a larger scaler and wasn't designed for print, how would you imagine it to be?>

  I would add more interactions to show the data in details, such as numbers and notes.
